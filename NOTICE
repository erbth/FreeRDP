I, Thomas Erbesdobler <t.erbesdobler@team103.com>, have modified some files
of the original FreeRDP, and created some more. From what I understood, this
is now a derivative work of FreeRDP, according to the terms of the Apache License Version 2.

I've added a NOTE statement to those files, I've modified.
The original projects is available at www.freerdp.com.

I don't like talking about the changes I've made, but please feel free to contact me.
All I want to say is Thank You to all those people at FreeRDP, to Marc-Andre Moreau
and everyone else there.
